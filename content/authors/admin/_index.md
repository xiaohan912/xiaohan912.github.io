I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://agecon.uga.edu/) at the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/).

My research focuses on assessing the climate risks, including physical and transition risks faced by rural banks and the effectiveness of adaptation by farmers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to climate change.

Before joining the University of Georgia, I was a Research Fellow at the [Environmental Research Center](https://env.dukekunshan.edu.cn/) of [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/).
